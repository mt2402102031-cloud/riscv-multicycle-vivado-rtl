# Architecture Overview

This document describes the architecture of the multicycle RISC-V processor
implemented and verified using Vivado.

## High-Level Architecture
The processor follows a multicycle design approach with a clear separation
between datapath and control logic. Instruction execution is distributed across
multiple clock cycles to reduce hardware complexity while maintaining correct
operation.

## Datapath Description
The datapath consists of the following major components:
- Program Counter (PC)
- Instruction Register
- Register File
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Data Memory Interface
- Multiple multiplexers for operand selection and write-back control

Each instruction progresses through the datapath over multiple cycles as
controlled by the control FSM.

## Control Unit
The control logic is implemented as a centralized finite state machine (FSM).
The FSM generates control signals for:
- Instruction fetch
- Decode and register read
- Execute and address calculation
- Memory access
- Write-back

## Execution Control Mechanism
An execution control feature is implemented to allow safe halting and resuming
of instruction execution based on control conditions. This ensures stable
operation without corrupting processor state.

## Elaborated Design
The following figure shows the elaborated RTL design generated by Vivado,
confirming correct module connectivity before synthesis.
