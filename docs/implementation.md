# Synthesis and Implementation

This document summarizes the synthesis and implementation flow carried out
using Vivado.

## Synthesis
The RTL design was synthesized targeting the selected FPGA device. Synthesis
results confirm correct mapping of RTL logic into FPGA primitives.

## Implementation
The synthesized design was implemented through placement and routing.
Timing constraints were applied and verified during implementation.

## Timing Closure
Post-implementation timing analysis reports no setup or hold violations,
confirming successful timing closure.

## Implementation Summary
The implementation flow demonstrates that the design is physically realizable
and meets all functional and timing requirements.
